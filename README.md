# Vertebral-Column-Data-Set_Deploy-with-Streamlit
Using an UCI dataset, this project goal is to classify orthopaedic patients into 3 classes (normal, disk hernia or spondilolysthesis) and then deploy the solution using Streamlit app.

This solution is composed by four files:

- Vertebral Column Dataset_Deploy with Streamlit.ipynb;
- app_hernia.py;
- column_3c_weka.csv;
- maquina_preditiva.pkl.

To deploy this solution, the files below should be stored in the same directory. Then, the next steps must be followed:

- If the streamlit is not downloaded, in the terminal, write "pip install streamlit"
- Still in the terminal, search the directory where the files are stored and than write "streamlit run app_hernia.py".

If all the steps above were taken, the solution will be deployed in localhost.
